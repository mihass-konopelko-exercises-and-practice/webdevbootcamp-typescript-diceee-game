# Diceee Game (with TypeScript)
This exercise was part of the Web Development Bootcamp by Udemy. The exercise focused on developing a dice rolling game where a user would press a button to roll two dice, one per player. Once the roll commenced, an appropriate die face should be displayed above the player, as well as message declaring one of the players as winners. 

The exercise is an interpretation of this challenge with the following differences:
- Instead of using images for dice, I draw them via CSS (CSS for dice was designed by Edvin from here: https://dev.to/ekeijl/creating-dice-using-css-grid-j4)
- Instead of using the skeleton project, I wrote everything from scratch and used Bootstrap 5.1.
- Instead of using pure JavaScript, I used TypeScript.
